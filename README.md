## General Information
The goal of the programs is familiarity with recursive functions
In all recursions:
* Loops are forbidden
* Declaration of global/static variables is forbidden

The setting in every work is the dynamic memory allocation
Each program runs the menu repeatedly [^1] until its successful termination.
Print messages according to outputs.


## Parts
1. Mirror pair [^2][^3]
2. Condition investigation



## Setup
C IDE environment (Dev C++ implemented)

## How to run
* On Linux (assumed gcc is installed)
```
gcc -o LABXXX LABXXXX.c
./LABXXXX
```
where XXXX is the id number of the project

* On Windows (in Dev C++)
1. Import .c file to workshop
2. Compile & Run

## Acknowledgements
- This project was created for the requirements of the lesson Structured programming
- First steps on learning C

[^1]: The user can give different input  many times. 
[^2]: The point is the sum of mirror pair to be equal to the first element of the table.
[^3]: Indexes with symmetrical positions with respect to the middle of the table.
[^4]: Data of each node (other than the last 2) is less than the product of the data of the next 2 nodes in the list.
